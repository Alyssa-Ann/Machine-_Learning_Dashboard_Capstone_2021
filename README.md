# Google Play App Analysis 

## Topic Selection
Google Play  is Android's official store for app purchases including games, music, educational tools, communications, and travel. A publicly accessible dataset with information on current app sales has been used to make predictions and analyze what attributes of an app can drive user installs. In order to make our predictions more comprehensive, we have also included user ratings and the designation of "Editor's Choice".  We are conducting this analysis so it can give developers insight to help make future successful apps. In this model, success is defined by a proprietary algorithm composed of data taken from ratings and installs.

## Research Questions
1. How does one define an app as successful?
2. Do  certain categories of apps see more installs or higher ratings?
3. If a developer were to create a new app, what features should this app have to make it successful? 

## Data Source
The initial dataset was sourced from Kaggle. See https://www.kaggle.com/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps for the original csv file. This data source has been cleaned of any superfluous columns.

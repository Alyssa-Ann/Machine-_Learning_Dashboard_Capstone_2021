# Successful Google Play App Exploration

## Project Team: 
- Thomas Bradley
- Chirayu Chaudhari
- Alyssa D'Antuono
- Mihir Gokhale

## Proposition
Using data acquired from Kaggle about apps from the Google Play Store, it can be determined what features have the most impact in making an app successful or not, and if future apps created by developers have a chance of being successful. These hypotheses will be tested through a thorough data cleaning using Pandas, databases for static data storage, and supervised machine learning models to determine the theory's accuracy. This data will then be presented in an interactive website that future developers can use to determine if the app they are planning to build has a chance of being successful. 

## Communication Protocols
The team will be communicating primarily over Slack and Google Docs. The files and databases will be shared on Github.
